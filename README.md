# Caesar Cipher

This is a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique.

## Overview

The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in a message by a certain number of places down the alphabet. This script allows you to encode or decode messages using the Caesar Cipher.

## Files

- `art.py`: Contains ASCII art for the script's logo.

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. Choose whether you want to encode or decode a message.
3. Enter your message.
4. Enter the shift number (how many places to shift each letter).
5. The script will output the encoded or decoded message.

Notes

    The script preserves spaces and non-alphabetic characters.
    If the shift number is greater than 26, it wraps around to start from the beginning of the alphabet again.
